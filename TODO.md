# Luminara 3D Website - Implementation TODO

## Project Setup & Dependencies
- [x] Install additional dependencies (Three.js, Framer Motion, React Hook Form)
- [x] Configure Tailwind with custom Luminara colors and 3D utilities
- [x] Set up global fonts (Inter/Poppins) and base styles
- [x] Create reusable 3D components library

## Core Infrastructure
- [x] Create root layout with consistent 3D navigation
- [x] Implement user journey progress tracking context
- [x] Set up authentication context and routing
- [x] Build global 3D design system components

## Page Implementation (10 Pages)
- [x] **Page 1**: Login/Register Page (`/auth`) - 3D glassmorphism login
- [x] **Page 2**: Welcome Page (`/welcome`) - Hero with 3D animations
- [x] **Page 3**: Profile Completion (`/profile`) - Multi-step 3D form wizard
- [ ] **Page 4**: Roadmap Page (`/roadmap`) - Interactive 3D pathway
- [ ] **Page 5**: Psychometric Test (`/psychometric`) - 3D assessment interface
- [ ] **Page 6**: Career Analysis (`/career-analysis`) - 3D career dashboard
- [ ] **Page 7**: Course Mapping (`/course-mapping`) - Skills & course 3D visualization
- [ ] **Page 8**: Learning Path (`/learning-path`) - Personalized 3D learning dashboard
- [ ] **Page 9**: College Directory (`/colleges`) - 3D college search interface
- [ ] **Page 10**: Timeline Tracker (`/timeline`) - Interactive 3D timeline

## 3D Components & Animations
- [ ] Build 3D glassmorphism card components
- [ ] Create floating navigation with 3D effects
- [ ] Implement progress indicators and journey tracking
- [ ] Add micro-animations for all interactive elements

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Testing & Deployment
- [ ] API testing with curl for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Test all 3D animations and interactions
- [ ] Verify responsive design across devices
- [ ] Build and deploy final application

## Progress Tracking
- Current Status: Starting implementation
- Completed: 0/10 pages
- Next: Project setup and dependencies
